Use that value, to produce the B/S
Demonstrate that A = L + E
Print both the P&L and B/S as clear as possible on the Result Grids
Show the % change vs. the previous year for every major line item on the P&L and B/S
Give some headings to each major account line item. And to each section of the P&L and B/S
Add any additional financial metrics and ratios that could be useful to analyze this start-up
